\section{Typed Clojure}

Typed Clojure is a gradual type system for Clojure, based on the
static portion of Typed Racket.

% what are the goals of Typed Clojure?
% where do they differ from Typed Racket? why?

% Things todo
% - small calculus based on previous TR formalisation
%   that demos the ``flow'' environment & not/intersection type
% - discussion and examples for flow filters
% - discussion on the not/difference type, real code where it helps
% - higher-rank polymorphism, show what it enables (eg. monads)
%   - also show more complicated example, making an extensible
%     type for clojure.core/conj, and why it's not straightforward
% - discussion on limitations of local type inference
% - demonstration of how we check multimethods
% - dealing with array covariance
% - note on how we avoid null-pointer exceptions
% - discussion on why Typed Clojure only uses the ``static'' part
%   of Typed Racket
% - the equality filter problem (and draft solution?), a proposition
%   that knows about binding aliasing. Sounds straightforward?

\section{Higher-rank polymorphism}

Typed Clojure supports f-bounded polymorphism and higher-rank
types.

\section{Using negative filters}

Occurrence typing plays an important role in Typed Racket and Typed Clojure.
By maintaining a \emph{proposition environment} of propositions relating types to
bindings, we can update bindings with more accurate types as programs progress.
It follows that there is some correspondence between propositions and types,
characterised by the \emph{update} function, which takes a type and a proposition
and returns a type which updates the input type using the proposition.

There is a straightforward relationship between ``positive'' propositions and types.
For example 
{\tt (update Number (is Integer 0))}
updates Number by Integer, which is Integer, because Integer <: Number.

The relationship between ``negative'' propositions and types is not always obvious.
A common proposition in Typed Clojure is (! (U nil false) a): the proposition that
local binding ``a'' is \emph{not} of type (U nil false).
This problem is most visible in expressions like {\tt (filter identity coll)}, where
``identity'' has a ``then'' proposition that has negative information: (! (U nil false) 0),
which reads, the 0th argument of identity does not contain (U nil false).

\section{Java interoperability}

As Clojure supports Java interoperability, Typed Clojure has some
integration with Java's type system. Calls to Java methods from
Clojure can be type checked by Typed Clojure.

We currently do not support Java generics

\subsection{Arrays}

Supporting statically sound interactions with Java arrays is a goal
of Typed Clojure. This is complicated by Java's decision to make
arrays covariant in their argument, a well documented source of static
unsoundness.

Our basic approach is to make our array types \emph{bivariant}. Array types
look like \lstinline|(Array2 w r)| and
are reminicent of functions or pipes: having a contravariant parameter for input (writing)
and a covariant parameter for output (reading).

Most commonly, an array type is invariant in its parameter; it can
write and read input of the same type.
We can get the same effect by setting our input and output
parameters to the same type. For example, \lstinline|(Array2 Number Number)|
(or equivalently, \lstinline|(Array Number)|)
in Typed Clojure is similar to invariant array types of \lstinline|Number| in languages like Scala.

The biggest gain in using a separate input parameter is the ability
to specify \emph{read-only} arrays. Crucially, our type system features an
explicit bottom type \lstinline|Nothing|, allowing a read-only \lstinline|Number| array
to be of type \lstinline|(Array2 Nothing Number)|.

To realise why defining read-only arrays are useful, we need to examine
what makes array covariance unsound in Java.
Array covariance lets us lie about the type of an array so the consumer
of an array cannot tell the actual type of the array when examining a type
signature.

\begin{verbatim}
...
public static Number[] getNumberArray() {
  Number[] n = new Integer[10];
  return n;
}
...
\end{verbatim}

To the casual consumer \emph{getNumberArray} returns an array that can both
read and write \lstinline|Number|s. However it is clear from the implementation
that attempting to write say a \lstinline|Double| to this array will result
in a runtime error.

\begin{verbatim}
...
Number[] myArray = getNumberArray();
myArray[0] = 1.1;
/* Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayStoreException: java.lang.Double */
...
\end{verbatim}

Notice that this is a runtime error, and Java's type system has not helped
statically prevent it.
This could cause a similar issue for other statically-typed languages offering
interoperability with Java. 

To prevent these sorts of runtime exceptions in Typed Clojure, we declare
all arrays from unknown sources to be \emph{read-only}. Put differently,
the only way to define a writeable array is to create it in type-checked Clojure
code.

\begin{lstlisting}
(let [n (CovariantArray/getNumberArray)]
  (aset n 0 1.1))

; Polymorphic static method clojure.lang.RT/aset could not be 
; applied to arguments:
; Domains: 
;         (Array2 i o) clojure.core.typed/AnyInteger i
; 
; Arguments:
;         (Array2 Nothing java.lang.Number) int (Value 1.1)
; 
; with expected type:
;         Any
\end{lstlisting}

The type inferred for the local \lstinline|n| is (Array2 Nothing Number)
which tells the type system: it is never safe to write to this array, but
it is safe to assume \lstinline|Number|s can be read from this array.

To emphasise, this is a static type error. Errors like this help Clojure programmers
use foreign Java libraries more correctly.

\begin{verbatim}
Note that Java libraries are often large and complex and programmers will probably
enjoy the extra help from the type system.
